- 👋 Hi, I’m @YaBoiHunta
- 👀 I’m interested in Coding, Cats, Flowers and Games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Front End Development and Front End Testing. Anything computer related, you probably already got me interested.  
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, maybe even a little game project of our own 👏. My mind goes everywhere but if you keep me on track i can work through and learn things.

- Currently learning and messing around with my own projects. Trying to build my own portfolio of some level to show to others of what i can do. Right now i am trying to learn Three JS to make a 3D website.
